## 🔧 How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication** (8-step OAuth2-like flow):
   - Retrieves CSRF token and transaction ID
   - Submits login credentials
   - Confirms authentication
   - Obtains session cookies
   - Gets file download token

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Downloads half-hourly electricity usage data in CSV format
   - Parses and filters data (keeps last 90 days)
   - Calculates totals for each sensor's time period

3. **Caching**:
   - Data is cached for **24 hours** to minimize API calls
   - Automatic refresh every 24 hours
   - Manual refresh possible via Home Assistant Developer Tools

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **5 retry attempts** on network failures
   - **2-minute wait** between retries
   - **Next-day retry** if all attempts fail (24-hour cache expiry)

### Update Frequency

- **ESB Data Updates**: ESB Networks typically updates smart meter data once per day
- **Integration Polling**: Every 24 hours
- **Data Freshness**: Usually 1-2 days behind real-time (ESB processing delay)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### CAPTCHA Protection

ESB Networks has implemented CAPTCHA protection on their login system. This integration includes:
- ✅ **70+ diverse user agents** to minimize detection
- ✅ **Random delays** between requests (2-20 seconds)
- ✅ **CAPTCHA detection** with clear error messages

**If CAPTCHA is triggered:**
- The integration will log a clear error message
- You may see: `"ESB Networks requires CAPTCHA verification"`
- This could be temporary rate limiting or permanent security change
- Currently **no automated solution** exists for CAPTCHA bypass

### Data Availability

- ESB Networks data is typically **1-2 days behind** real-time
- Data updates **once per day** on ESB's servers (usually overnight)
- First data may take **24-48 hours** after smart meter installation

### API Limitations

- This integration uses ESB's **consumer-facing web interface** (not an official API)
- ESB may change their authentication flow at any time
- Integration may break if ESB makes website changes
